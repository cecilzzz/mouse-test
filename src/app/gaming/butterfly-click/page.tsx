    question: "What is Butterfly Clicking and How Does It Work?",
    answer: `${phrases.butterflyClick} is an advanced clicking technique where players use two fingers alternating rapidly on the same mouse button to achieve high click speeds (8-15 CPS). Unlike ${phrases.jitterClick}, butterfly clicking focuses on finger coordination and rhythm rather than arm vibration. Our ${links.butterfly} measures finger coordination, rhythm consistency, and technique detection. The method involves using index and middle finger alternating clicks, creating a sustainable high-CPS technique that's less straining than jitter clicking but requires excellent finger coordination.`,

  {
    question: "How to Learn Butterfly Clicking - Complete Tutorial",
    answer: `Learning ${phrases.butterflyClick} technique: 1) **Finger positioning** - Place index and middle finger on left mouse button, 2) **Alternating rhythm** - Practice steady alternating pattern between fingers, 3) **Timing coordination** - Ensure fingers don't click simultaneously, 4) **Pressure control** - Use light, quick taps rather than heavy presses, 5) **Practice consistency** - Focus on maintaining even intervals between clicks, 6) **Gradual speed increase** - Start slow and build up coordination. Use our ${links.butterfly} to track progress and identify timing inconsistencies. Easier to learn than ${phrases.jitterClick} but requires dedicated practice.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Butterfly Click vs Jitter Click vs Regular Click",
    answer: `Clicking technique comparison: **Regular clicking** (2-8 CPS) - Single finger, sustainable, good for general use, **${phrases.butterflyClick}** (8-15 CPS) - Two fingers alternating, balanced speed and endurance, excellent coordination training, **${phrases.jitterClick}** (10-20+ CPS) - Arm vibration, highest speed but more strain. ${phrases.butterflyClick} advantages: easier to learn than jitter, less physical strain, more sustainable for long gaming sessions, better finger dexterity development. Our tests compare performance across ${links.butterfly}, ${links.jitter}, and regular clicking patterns.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Gaming Applications and Competitive Advantages",
    answer: `${phrases.butterflyClick} in competitive gaming: **Minecraft PvP** - Balanced CPS for combat without excessive strain, **FPS games** - Rapid firing for automatic weapons, **MOBA games** - Quick ability casting and item usage, **Strategy games** - Fast unit selection and commands. Optimal CPS ranges: 10-12 CPS for balanced gameplay, 12-15 CPS for competitive performance. Combine with ${links.minecraft} training for Minecraft-specific applications. Many gamers prefer ${phrases.butterflyClick} over ${phrases.jitterClick} for tournaments due to sustainability and lower injury risk.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Finger Coordination and Rhythm Training",
    answer: `Improving ${phrases.butterflyClick} coordination: **Metronome training** - Practice clicking to steady beats, **Finger independence exercises** - Develop separate finger control, **Rhythm patterns** - Practice various alternating speeds, **Muscle memory development** - Consistent daily practice sessions, **Coordination drills** - Use piano finger exercises adapted for clicking. Our ${links.butterfly} provides real-time coordination feedback and identifies rhythm inconsistencies. Good coordination (80%+) indicates proper technique mastery. Regular practice improves both gaming performance and general finger dexterity.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Health Benefits and Safety of Butterfly Clicking",
    answer: `${phrases.butterflyClick} health considerations: **Lower strain** - Less wrist and arm stress compared to ${phrases.jitterClick}, **Finger exercise** - Develops finger independence and coordination, **Sustainable technique** - Can be used for longer periods without fatigue, **Injury prevention** - Proper technique reduces repetitive strain risk. **Safety guidelines**: Warm up fingers before sessions, take regular breaks, maintain proper posture, stop if experiencing discomfort. ${phrases.butterflyClick} is generally safer than ${phrases.jitterClick} but still requires responsible practice to avoid overuse injuries.`,
    category: "basic"
  },
  {
    question: "Optimal Gaming Mouse Setup for Butterfly Clicking",
    answer: `Best ${phrases.gamingMouse} features for ${phrases.butterflyClick}: **Responsive switches** - Low actuation force for light finger taps, **Large button surface** - Comfortable for two-finger placement, **Consistent button response** - Uniform activation across button surface, **Low latency** - Quick response for alternating clicks. Recommended mice: Logitech G Pro X Superlight, Razer DeathAdder V3, Glorious Model D, SteelSeries Prime. Mouse settings: 1000Hz polling rate, minimal click delay. Test your setup with our ${links.butterfly} to optimize finger placement and timing.`,
