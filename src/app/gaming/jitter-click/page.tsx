    question: "What is Jitter Clicking and How Does It Work?",
    answer: `${phrases.jitterClick} is an advanced clicking technique used in competitive gaming, particularly Minecraft PvP, where players use rapid wrist and arm movements to achieve extremely high click speeds (10-20+ CPS). The technique involves tensing arm muscles and creating controlled vibrations to generate multiple clicks per second. Our ${links.jitter} measures click intervals, consistency, and technique detection to help you master this skill. Unlike regular clicking, ${phrases.jitterClick} requires specific muscle memory and can achieve CPS rates impossible with finger clicking alone.`,

  {
    question: "How to Learn Jitter Clicking - Step by Step Guide",
    answer: `Learning ${phrases.jitterClick} technique: 1) **Proper grip** - Hold mouse with fingertips, not palm, 2) **Arm positioning** - Rest forearm on desk edge for stability, 3) **Tension technique** - Tense arm muscles while keeping hand relaxed, 4) **Vibration control** - Create controlled shaking motion from forearm, 5) **Practice consistency** - Focus on maintaining rhythm over speed, 6) **Gradual improvement** - Start with 8-10 CPS and build up slowly. Use our ${links.jitter} to track progress and identify areas for improvement. Warning: Practice in moderation to avoid muscle strain or injury.`,

    question: "Jitter Clicking for Minecraft PvP - Competitive Advantage",
    answer: `${phrases.jitterClick} in Minecraft PvP provides significant advantages: **Higher DPS** - More hits per second increases damage output, **Combo potential** - Rapid clicking enables longer hit combos, **Knockback advantage** - More hits create better knockback control, **Weapon switching** - Faster inventory management, **Block placement** - Rapid building techniques. Optimal Minecraft PvP CPS ranges: 12-16 CPS for balanced play, 16+ CPS for aggressive combat. Combine ${phrases.jitterClick} with ${links.minecraft} training for complete PvP preparation. Note: Some servers have CPS limits to prevent unfair advantage.`,

  {
    question: "Jitter Click vs Regular Click vs Butterfly Click",
    answer: `Clicking technique comparison: **Regular clicking** (2-8 CPS) - Uses finger movement, sustainable for long periods, good for casual gaming, **${phrases.jitterClick}** (10-20 CPS) - Uses arm vibration, higher strain but faster speeds, excellent for competitive PvP, **${phrases.butterflyClick}** (8-15 CPS) - Uses two fingers alternating, balanced speed and endurance. Our tests for ${links.jitter} and ${links.butterfly} help determine your optimal technique. Choose based on game requirements: regular for general use, ${phrases.jitterClick} for maximum speed, ${phrases.butterflyClick} for sustained performance.`,

  {
    question: "Health and Safety of Jitter Clicking",
    answer: `${phrases.jitterClick} health considerations: **Potential risks** - Muscle strain, repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, **Prevention tips** - Take regular breaks, stretch exercises, proper ergonomics, **Practice limits** - Maximum 30 minutes per session, **Warning signs** - Hand pain, numbness, tingling sensations. **Safe practice guidelines**: Warm up before sessions, use proper mouse grip, maintain good posture, stop if experiencing discomfort. ${phrases.gamingMouse} with ergonomic design can reduce strain. Balance ${phrases.jitterClick} training with other techniques to avoid overuse injuries.`,
