  {
    question: "What is Minecraft CPS and Why Does It Matter for PvP?",
    answer: `Minecraft ${phrases.cpsTest} measures clicks per second specifically for Minecraft PvP combat effectiveness. In Minecraft, higher CPS translates to more hits per second, better combo potential, increased knockback, and faster block placement. Our ${links.minecraft} is optimized for Minecraft's combat mechanics and server limitations. Typical Minecraft PvP CPS ranges: 6-8 CPS (casual), 8-12 CPS (competitive), 12+ CPS (professional). However, many servers limit CPS to prevent unfair advantages, so check server rules before optimizing for maximum speed.`,

  },
  {
    question: "Optimal CPS for Different Minecraft Game Modes",
    answer: `Minecraft CPS requirements by game mode: **Bedwars/Skywars** (8-12 CPS) - Balance of speed and accuracy for combo fights, **UHC/Hardcore** (6-10 CPS) - Precision over speed for critical hits, **Practice servers** (10-15 CPS) - Training for maximum combat effectiveness, **Survival PvP** (8-12 CPS) - Sustained combat performance. Our ${links.minecraft} helps identify your optimal CPS for different scenarios. Remember: accuracy and timing are often more important than raw CPS in actual PvP situations. Practice with realistic scenarios rather than just maximum clicking speed.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Minecraft Server CPS Limits and Anti-Cheat",
    answer: `Common Minecraft server CPS restrictions: **Hypixel** - 15 CPS maximum, **Minemen Club** - 20 CPS limit, **PvP Legacy** - 20 CPS maximum, **Most servers** - 8-20 CPS range acceptable. Anti-cheat systems detect: consistent high CPS (20+ sustained), robotic clicking patterns, impossible click rates. Our ${links.minecraft} trains within legitimate human performance ranges. **Important**: Always respect server rules and community standards. Focus on technique improvement (${links.jitter}, ${links.butterfly}) rather than exploiting game mechanics. Banned for high CPS? Usually indicates unrealistic clicking patterns.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Best Minecraft PvP Clicking Techniques",
    answer: `Minecraft PvP clicking techniques comparison: **Regular clicking** (6-8 CPS) - Sustainable, good for long fights, **${phrases.jitterClick}** (10-16 CPS) - High burst speed, excellent for combos, **${phrases.butterflyClick}** (8-14 CPS) - Balanced speed and endurance, **Drag clicking** (15-25 CPS) - Specialized technique, server-dependent legality. Train with our ${links.minecraft}, ${links.jitter}, and ${links.butterfly} tests. Best technique depends on: server limits, personal comfort, game mode requirements, fight duration. Many professional Minecraft PvPers use butterfly clicking for balance of speed and sustainability.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Minecraft Combat Mechanics and CPS Effectiveness",
    answer: `Understanding Minecraft combat mechanics: **Attack cooldown** - 1.9+ versions have attack timing, affecting CPS benefit, **Damage calculation** - Higher CPS increases DPS potential, **Knockback mechanics** - More hits create better combo control, **Block breaking** - Higher CPS for faster block destruction, **Food/item usage** - Rapid consumption in combat. CPS effectiveness varies by Minecraft version: 1.8 PvP benefits most from high CPS, 1.9+ requires timing consideration. Our ${links.minecraft} provides version-specific training recommendations.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Minecraft PvP Training and Improvement Guide",
    answer: `Comprehensive Minecraft PvP training routine: **CPS training** - Daily practice with our ${links.minecraft}, **Combo practice** - Focus on hit sequences and timing, **Aim training** - Cursor precision and target tracking, **Movement drills** - W-tapping, S-tapping, strafing, **Block hitting** - Defensive techniques and counter-attacks. Training progression: Start with ${links.cpsMain} basics, advance to ${links.jitter} or ${links.butterfly}, combine with actual PvP practice. Recommended training schedule: 15-20 minutes CPS practice, 30+ minutes actual PvP combat. Join practice servers for realistic training scenarios.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Gaming Setup Optimization for Minecraft PvP",
    answer: `Optimal Minecraft PvP setup: **${phrases.gamingMouse}** - Lightweight, responsive switches, high polling rate (1000Hz), **Mouse pad** - Large surface for wide movements, consistent texture, **Settings** - Disable mouse acceleration, optimize sensitivity, **Keyboard** - Mechanical switches for faster key response, **Performance** - High FPS (200+), low input lag, stable connection. Recommended mice for Minecraft PvP: Logitech G Pro, Razer Viper, Glorious Model O. Test your complete setup with our ${links.minecraft} to identify optimization opportunities.`,
    category: "gaming"
  },
  {
    question: "Professional Minecraft PvP Players and CPS",
    answer: `Professional Minecraft PvPer CPS ranges: **Technoblade** (8-12 CPS average), **Dream** (10-14 CPS in combat), **Fruitberries** (12-16 CPS peak), **Most pros** (8-15 CPS range). Key insight: Professional players focus on consistency, accuracy, and game sense over maximum CPS. High CPS helps but isn't everything - timing, positioning, and strategy matter more. Study professional gameplay to understand when high CPS is beneficial vs. when precision clicking is more important. Our ${links.minecraft} helps develop both speed and control for well-rounded PvP performance.`,
